# food-bridge-system

Design & Develop a Backend System for Delivery/Dining Food Portal like Swiggy or Zomato. The 
business idea is to bridge the gap between service providers (Food Outlets/Restaurants) and service 
receivers (Consumers - Users).
â€¢ Service Receivers(Consumers) can place their food orders or book dining. They can
avail all these services via placing an order through the Mobile App / Portal. 
â€¢ Create a Login forthe application with pre-defined users and aftersuccessful login, user 
can start search based on below criteria:
o Search should have all input parameters as Area Code (Like Sector 29), Food & 
Restaurant search.
o Once Search istriggered afterspecifying the search parameters, it will display the 
search results.
o Users can mark restaurants as favorite for empty search result it should come at top.
â€¢ Next Step, User can add in-stock items & place order for a restaurant.
â€¢ User should be able to fetch restaurant-related details, such as managing restaurant profiles, 
operating hours, and location information.
â€¢ For Delivery â€“ User should be able to fetch food items offered by restaurants, including their 
prices, descriptions, and availability & category.
â€¢ For Dining â€“ Select restaurant, date, time slot & no. of people. 
â€¢ When an orderis placed, order invoice will be generated at the backend system and then
various background validation happens in the system with respect to availability & 
payment confirmationâ€¦ so on and so forth. Based on validation status, order status will 
be updated in the system.
â€¢ The consumer will also get a notification with respect to the order confirmation and
service provider details & Food outlet will also get the Detailed Description for customer 
& Other details (ex- Address, Contact Number of Consumer & order details).
â€¢ In case of any failure (eg; payment failure, order rejected by provider), consumer will
receive notification for order cancelled.
